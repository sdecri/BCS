# BCS
Best Common Subsequence


This is an implementation of the generalized Longest Common Subsequence problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence_problem), with variable weights.

The standard LCS is indeed a special case (constant weights equals to 1) of the general problem.

The example below shows the resolved example of a generic involving elements with different weights (in red).
